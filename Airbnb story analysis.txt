After analyzing the Airbnb horror stories, a pattern emerges that highlights common elements and structures that make these 
narratives compelling and chilling. The language is descriptive, creating vivid and immersive scenes that pull the reader into 
the experience. Descriptions are detailed, focusing on the unsettling and eerie aspects of the settings and characters involved. 
The stories are rooted in realism, making the horror elements more impactful because they seem plausible, thus amplifying the fear 
factor.

Horror effects are achieved through suspense, unexpected twists, and the exploitation of real-life fears, such as break-ins,
 encounters with unstable individuals, or being watched. These stories often begin innocuously, with characters in ordinary 
 situations that rapidly devolve into terror, and they frequently end on an open, unresolved note, leaving the reader with 
 lingering unease.

Typically, the stories involve a small number of characters, often solo travelers or couples, which allows for a more intimate 
and intense focus on their psychological experience. The horror unfolds as these characters interact with their environment, 
the local inhabitants, or discover something sinister about the Airbnb property itself.

Story types:
- Intrusive Hosts: Stories focusing on hosts who violate guests' privacy or become overly involved in their stay.
- Paranormal Experiences: Tales that involve supernatural occurrences within the Airbnb property.
- Unsafe Conditions: Narratives centered around properties that are in disrepair, unclean, or located in dangerous areas.
- Scams and Deceptions: Stories about guests being misled by listings or falling victim to scams.
- Unwelcome Guests: Accounts of unexpected visitors, such as break-ins or encounters with wildlife. 
- Animals: Stories where wild or tame animals plays a part in the problem or the resolution.
- Hosts as victims for plays by bad guests.
