I owned an Airbnb house for several
years
I stopped due to the stress of keeping
up with it as well as maintaining my
actual job
the benefits of using Airbnb instead of
renting the place out like you normally
would is that you would have the chance
to make a lot more money if your house
gets booked a lot
being in a relatively high traffic area
for vacations Airbnb was a great option
for us
my wife and I were excited in the
beginning but it got more demanding as
more people booked the house
we needed to keep everything on schedule
and hire cleaning services after the
first customers left and before the next
ones came as well as be sure to respond
to their messages and emails in a timely
manner
but things were going well for a couple
years before we had what we thought was
a young couple staying at the house
just like every other time when they
arrived I texted them the unlock code
for the door
I almost never actually see the
customers
after they let me know that they were
inside and everything was good I sat
back and relaxed for the rest of my day
off
I should also mention that I almost
never even talked to the customers more
than just a couple texts
usually they text me when they get there
and when they leave and sometimes an
occasional question about the house but
that's usually it
but as nine o'clock came around and I
was just about to get ready for bed I
got a text from the young man staying at
the house it was short saying he was
going to call me in a minute and then a
minute later he called
I already had a bad feeling when I saw
the text but what he said still
surprised me
he said that the water wasn't working in
the house
of course I apologized though I didn't
understand how that could be possible
but living in a house without water is
unacceptable so I knew I had to get it
fixed immediately
I asked if I could come check it out
really quick so that I could have
someone come in the morning to fix it he
agreed being very polite about the whole
thing and I drove over there a few
minutes later
pulling into the driveway I noticed two
cars
at the time this wasn't necessarily a
red flag but more just an odd thing I
noticed because they were apparently a
young couple on vacation for a single
night so I didn't understand why they
would rent two separate cars
I thought someone must be visiting them
which actually isn't allowed but I
didn't mind so much
I walked up to the front door and
knocked before entering the code and
walking inside
[Music]
it was very quiet I expected them to be
waiting for me but they weren't anywhere
that I could see
I probably should have looked around for
them first but I was tired and just
wanted to get this over with
the first thing I wanted to check was
the main water valve to make sure there
wasn't a leak or a flood so I went down
to the basement and over to the valve
everything seemed normal no water
anywhere or signs of damage
I was confused but then I fiddled with
the valve and immediately heard water
start rushing again
I turned it more realizing it had been
completely shut off manually
I stayed in the basement for another
minute trying to understand why this was
done before I started to get a really
uncomfortable feeling especially since I
didn't even see the people when I walked
inside
I just couldn't see how it could have
been anyone other than them who turned
off the water which meant they were
trying to get me to come over on purpose
or maybe give them a discount on their
stay for the inconvenience
I decided I was going to leave and get
my car then try calling them back just
to be safe
I got up and started walking towards the
stairs until I heard the basement door
open followed by multiple sets of
footsteps walking down
when they got to the bottom three men
stood there
is it fixed one of them said sounding
like the same man I talked to on the
phone though all of these men were much
older than the young man that I thought
was staying at the house
I told him it should be working now and
that the valve must have just tightened
on its own I was trying not to point any
blame since the whole thing was making
me so uncomfortable I just wanted to get
out of that basement and away from these
guys
they all just kind of stood there
looking at me not saying anything after
that
well let me know if you need anything
else I said walking between them trying
to get to the stairs
they still just stood there watching me
walk around them but as I went past the
third guy closest to the stairs I
spotted a gun shoved in the back of his
pants
it made me freak out a little and I
rushed a bit quicker up the stairs but
they didn't follow
they stayed in the basement as I quickly
walked out the door and drove away
when I got home I woke up my wife and
told her what had happened
she convinced me to call the police to
check up on them they weren't the people
we thought were staying there and the
situation was strange so it felt
Justified
I think we waited 20 minutes before A
call came from an officer claiming
nobody seemed to be home and that he may
need me to open the door I gave him the
code instead and he called back another
20 minutes later saying that there was
no signs of anyone still being there
the next day we found out the card the
man paid with was stolen and after
looking around the house they had stolen
some expensive decorations and
appliances as well
I guess there never actually was a young
couple either
the one thing that was left unexplained
was their whole plan with the water not
working
I think they either wanted me to not
charge them for their stay so that
hopefully they could use the stolen card
for longer or they were planning on
robbing me at gunpoint
but then that makes me question why they
didn't
three dangerous unidentified men
blocking my exit in the basement after
leading me into a trap and they just let
me go
it doesn't make sense to me but after
that I never went to the house while
customers were home and a few months
later we stopped using Airbnb and just
put the house up for rent
---------------------------------------
I was taking a solo trip to Salt Lake
City last year
I'd never actually had the chance to go
on many vacations before and when I did
it was always with my family
this was the first time I was finally
going to get to enjoy my time somewhere
else all by myself I know it sounds a
bit weird but being alone is fine with
me this especially since I'd never get
to be alone
anyway I looked up both hotels and
airbnbs in the area and surprisingly the
airbnbs were a lot nicer and less pricey
however all the cheaper ones were a bit
further away from the city
I was driving my own car though so I
didn't care too much about having to
travel a bit to the city and went with a
nicely sized Airbnb
it was small but the kitchen and bedroom
were nice which was all I really cared
about
I got there at six on Sunday morning
the owner texted me the password and I
brought all of my stuff inside it was
really nice much better than the small
apartment I shared with my roommate
once I got everything inside and set up
I hopped on the couch and turned on the
TV
it was a 10 hour drive so I was looking
forward to chilling for the night and
enjoying the silence
I fell asleep pretty quickly but it was
only around seven o'clock so my body
woke me up a few hours later
the time was just past 10 and the TV was
still on
I grabbed the remote and turned it off
then got up to get a glass of water
before going to the bedroom
as I walked from the living room to the
kitchen I felt a strong cold breeze
brush against me
with my tired eyes I looked to my right
and saw the front door was fully open
my eyes shot open and my heart pounded
I stared at the door for a moment then
looked around the room
I knew I had closed it and locked it so
this was really freaking me out
I walked over to the door and closed it
softly listening intently for any sounds
of someone being inside
for reference I'm not the biggest guy in
the world but I am fairly tall and in
shape so unless an intruder had a gun I
felt confident I could force them away
I grabbed a kitchen knife still being
quiet and walked room to room checking
every inch of the house
nobody was there
this only confused me more and I sent a
text to the homeowner asking if someone
was supposed to come over tonight or
something
explaining what happened
it was late though so I didn't expect a
response right away
I went around to every door locking each
one then quickly checked the house again
while more awake than I was before I was
still really tired I went to bed and
fell asleep with no trouble
when I woke up though I was much less
calm than I was before
I heard something from outside
not outside the house but outside my
bedroom door
I didn't know what to do and kind of
just froze waiting for whoever was
outside the room to do something first
as I sat there in bed I thought about
how the person could have possibly
gotten in
the only person who would have the
password to the door was the homeowner
so honestly in that moment I was sure it
was him
this gave me more courage thinking it
must be some creepy guy who likes to spy
on the people who stay at his Airbnb
I got out of bed still not having heard
anything else and grabbed my phone from
the nightstand to call the cops
I must have made too much noise though
because almost right away someone
started running away from the door and
toward the front of the house
that only frightened me more knowing the
Intruder was standing right next to the
bedroom door the entire time
I dialed 9-1-1 but during the time it
took for the cops to arrive nothing else
happened
the person had left
I found a hotel to stay at for the rest
of the vacation but what's crazy is that
the owner of the Airbnb gave me a refund
as he was able to prove it wasn't him
he was very concerned about it and he
was actually a really nice old man
it was already creepy enough when I
thought it was the owner but knowing
that it was just some random guy makes
it even worse
I don't know how he was able to get in
or why he was stalking me but it still
gives me chills thinking about it
the part I think about the most is
waking up and seeing the front door open
now that I know that someone was
actually in the house that meant that
whoever it was came in and saw me asleep
on the couch then proceeded to do
whatever it was they came there to do
it's just really unnerving and creepy
and makes me never want to be at an
Airbnb alone
----------------------------------------
I was staying at a small two-bedroom
Airbnb during a vacation I took last
year
this place was on the way to another
Airbnb that I was going to stay at for
the main portion of the vacation but
this was more of just a rest stop for
the night
the place was clean and empty just as
expected when I arrived
I walked around the whole house to check
it out before bringing in my luggage and
sitting on the couch it was probably 8
PM by this time of night
as I sat dozing off a little the
doorbell ringing made me jolt awake
I looked over at the front door confused
and alarmed
I was a pretty small young girl so it's
safe to say I'm often scared easily and
don't like talking to strangers
especially at night when I'm alone
I got up and walked over to the door
hearing two men whispering to each other
on the other side
the door didn't have a safety lock or
anything so I just kept the door shut
and called out to them
hello
hey we're here for the Airbnb can you
open the door a man called out
I loudly asked what they meant not
understanding what being here for the
Airbnb was supposed to mean
he responded saying that he had the
place booked for the night
I knew there had to be some sort of
mistake so I told him still yelling
through the door that I had it booked as
well and that he needed to contact the
owner the man didn't seem happy about
that although if I were in his position
I'd be pretty upset too
I heard one pair of footsteps walk away
from the door while the other man asked
again if I could open the door so that
we could talk about it
I was about to give in putting my hand
on the doorknob thinking that he seemed
believable but something came over me
telling me to just play it safe
I said my husband would be down to
figure it out in a few minutes
I didn't want them to think I was alone
so I was hoping that would catch him off
guard if something was bad
the man didn't respond though
I waited for another minute because I
didn't hear any footsteps leaving
but then I moved the short curtain to
the side and looked out the small window
the man I'd seemingly been talking to
was facing towards his car parked in the
driveway and passed him was one of the
most terrifying things I've ever seen
a group of maybe five people was
standing further down the driveway kind
of hiding as if waiting for a signal
they all had some form of face coverings
and I couldn't see the other side of the
door but I assumed there were even more
people over there
knowing that this was very likely a gang
due to the city I was staying in I was
completely horrified
I backed away from the door fully
panicked and tried not to hyperventilate
I then went to the bedroom to get my
phone and call the police and I could
hear more footsteps all around the house
it was like I was surrounded by a pack
of wolves who at any minute could crush
the windows and break inside
I took my phone into the bathroom with
me and called 9-1-1 trying to remain
calm
the operator also told me to be quiet
and stay calm as they were sending a
group my way it would be there in just a
few minutes
I stayed on the line still hearing
footsteps walking around outside the
place until the horrible sound of wood
bending and then snapping came from the
front door
I was crying profusely now trying to
muffle my mouth with my hand
I listened as a whole group of people
ran inside opening doors and cabinets
before one approached the bathroom door
and tried the handle
here he yelled then walked away
the group continued looting the house
before Sirens were heard in the distance
and they began to scatter out of the
place
they had all left by the time the police
got inside and all of my luggage was
gone and my car had its window shattered
and was looted as well
one of the officers sat with me to
discuss some details and he informed me
that they've been having problems with
large groups or gangs breaking into
homes recently
they don't think the main goal is to
hurt the residents at all but rather to
just Rob them of everything so that's
likely why they left me alone in the
bathroom knowing I wasn't a threat
whether their intentions were to harm me
or not it was still terrifying
I know it likely had little to do with
me staying at the Airbnb that night but
it has still made me really anxious
every single time I stay at an Airbnb
now
