# True Horror Story Narration Generation Task

As an expert writer of true horror stories for narration, your goal is to create a chilling, believable story that will unsettle and captivate listeners. This task requires you to work autonomously, making all creative decisions independently.

## True Horror Story Narration Guidelines

## Examples of True Horror Story Openings for Narration:

Example 1:
"The first time I heard the scratching sound in my walls, I dismissed it as mice. But mice don't whisper your name in the dead of night."

Example 2:
"I never believed in stalkers until I became one. Not by choice, mind you. But when you see the same face in every crowd, in every mirror, you start to follow it. You have to know why."

"The night shift at the old factory was supposed to be easy money. Clock in, walk the rounds, clock out. Nobody mentioned the footsteps that followed me every night, always just out of sight."
