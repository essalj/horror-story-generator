Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow,
And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.

In a small town, there was a legend about a cursed doll named Rosie. The doll had been passed down through generations, leaving tragedy in its wake. Anyone who owned Rosie met an untimely demise, and the doll always mysteriously reappeared in the possession of another unsuspecting victim.

A young woman named Emily inherited Rosie from her grandmother, who had warned her about the curse. Dismissing it as superstition, Emily kept the doll on a shelf in her bedroom. But strange things began to happen. Objects would move on their own, and Emily heard soft laughter when she was alone in the house.

One night, as Emily lay in bed, she heard the pitter-patter of little feet approaching. The door creaked open, and Rosie stood at the threshold, her eyes glinting in the dim moonlight. Emily's heart raced as she watched the doll move towards her with an unnatural grace.

"Go away, Rosie," Emily whispered, her voice trembling.

But the doll continued to advance, its porcelain face twisted into a menacing smile. Emily's fear turned to terror as she realized that Rosie was not just a doll; something malevolent inhabited its form.

In a panic, Emily grabbed the doll and threw it against the wall, hoping to shatter it and end the curse once and for all. As the porcelain cracked, a dark energy surged through the room, enveloping Emily in a suffocating embrace.

The next morning, locals found Emily's lifeless body in her bedroom, with Rosie lying beside her, unharmed. The legend of Rosie lived on, leaving behind a chilling mystery of what truly lurked within that cursed doll.

The end? Or is Rosie's legacy destined to claim more unsuspecting victims?
