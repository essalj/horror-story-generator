Hi, I have task for you.
1. Read the file Airbnb stories - All.txt
2. Write a plot for a new Airbnb horror story like the ones you just read-
     - 6 action beats
     - it is an Airbnb story that is highly realistic
     - No supernatural stuff, just scary or weird people and events
     - Write it in 1st person
3. For  each action beat create 2 image prompts that depicts the action
4. Write the story
   - begin the story eith a peaceful setting and an introduction that lets the audience understand it is a story told from memory
   - for each action beat beat, build oup the intensity, be very detailed in descriptions and use "show it- do not tell it" methodology
   - end the story good...like a lucky escape, the bad person left, or soomething  like that. But  keep it open ended.
5) Create the images
