## CRITICAL: Ouija Board Communication Presentation

This is a crucial aspect of the story. You MUST adhere to these guidelines:

1. ALWAYS present Ouija board communications as complete words or phrases.
2. NEVER spell out individual letters in the narrative.
3. Use phrases like "The board spelled out..." or "The planchette moved to spell..." to indicate Ouija board communication.

Correct Examples:
- "The board spelled out 'SHE STEPPED THROUGH'"
- "We watched in horror as the planchette moved to spell 'GET OUT'"
- "The Ouija board's message was clear: 'BEHIND YOU'"

Incorrect Examples (DO NOT USE):
- "S-H-E-S-T-E-P-P-E-D-T-H-R-O-U-G-H"
- "G-E-T-O-U-T"
- "The planchette moved to B, then E, then H..."

Remember: The goal is to maintain narrative flow and tension. Spelling out individual letters disrupts the pacing and atmosphere of the story.

If you need to convey a sense of slow or dramatic revelation, use descriptive language around the complete phrases, like:
"The planchette crawled agonizingly across the board, revealing one terrifying word at a time: 'HE... IS... HERE.'"

## Final Output
Present only the polished, complete story of 3000-4000 words without additional commentary or structural indicators. The story should begin with the crafted hook and flow seamlessly through the extended narrative structure, maintaining reader engagement throughout.

FINAL CHECK: Before submitting the story, ensure it meets the following criteria:
1. The story falls within the 3000-4000 word range.
2. It follows the five-act structure outlined in the planning stage.
3. All character arcs and subplots are introduced and resolved.
4. At least two Ouija board scenes are included, with escalating tension.
5. The hook effectively opens the story and draws the reader in.
6. All Ouija board communications follow the correct format of complete words or phrases, NEVER individual letters.
7. The narrative maintains a consistent tone and voice throughout.
8. Pacing varies appropriately to build and release tension.
9. Sensory details and atmosphere are richly developed.
10. Themes and deeper meanings are explored within the horror context.

Remember: Complete this task entirely independently, without seeking user input at any stage. Craft a chilling, immersive Ouija board experience that will resonate with readers long after they've finished the extended story.
