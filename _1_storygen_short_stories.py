0. Read the analysis of Airbnb stories.
1. Create 5 ideas for a plot to a new True Airbnb horror story drawing inspiration from the analysis of airbnb stories.
''' + user_input + '''
   - For each plot idea outline the central conflict and resolution. This is the story's backbone, guiding the narrative direction.
   - insert the the full description in a new json stucture with the column 'plot idea'-
2. Take on the role as a critic and die hard fan of the genre and rate the 5 plot ideas on a scale from 1-100. 
   - **Rating: For each "plot idea" in the json structure assign a rating on a scale from 1 to 100. A score of 100 signifies that the story idea has potential as an exemplary piece of horror literature, perfectly marrying imaginative horror elements with a realistic setting that is very likely to be a true story, while a score of 1 indicates significant areas for improvement.
   - **Explain Your Rating**: Provide a detailed explanation for your rating, considering plot consistency, character depth, the effectiveness of the horror elements within a realistic framework, and the storyâ€™s overall ability to engage and horrify the reader.

  - For each "plot idea" from the existing json add your rating, an explanation for the rating and a rank from 1-5 to the existing json stucture with the columns ['rating', 'raters comment','rank'].
  3. The json structure should be as in this example:\n
  ```json
[
    {
        "plot idea": "The Counterfeit Vacation.
        An Airbnb host discovers his guests are using his property to create and distribute counterfeit currency.
        The host outsmarts the guests by gathering evidence and anonymously tipping off the authorities, leading to their arrest while he remains safe.",
        "rating": 78,
        "raters comment": "The idea of a scam unfolding within the confines of an Airbnb property is intriguing and has potential for psychological depth, but it may lack direct horror elements.",
        "rank": 3
    }
    ...
    ]
    ```
4. Output nothing but the created json structure. 
''' + break_line + '''
Airbnb analysis: ''' + analysis + break_line

task_1 = main_task + break_line + '''\n
1. From the json input select the plot idea with the highest rank. 
 - For the selected plot idea decide on key action beats.
    - Identify ''' + str(action_beats_count) + ''' pivotal moments that advance the plot. 
    - These action beats should highlight character development, escalate tension, and move the story towards its climax.
2. Based on your suggested plot develop a story template for an Airbnb horror story with ''' + str(action_beats_count) + ''' action beats.
   Follow these guidelines: \n''' + guide_lines + ''' 
3. Insert the story template into a new  json stucture with the column ['story_template"].
4. For each action beat create 1 image prompts that depicts the action.
5. Add the action beats and the image prompts in the json stucture ['action_beat_no.", 'action_beat_desc", "image_prompt"]
6. Create 1 image prompt that depicts the Airbnb residence and its settings and add it to the json structure with the column 
name ["first-image"].
7. Output nothing but the created json structure. ''' + break_line + '''\nJSON input:'''

task_2 = main_task + break_line + '''
1. Read the story template and the action beats from the json structure to understand the plot.
2. Write following these guide lines: ''' + guide_lines + '''
3. First develop the characters in depth.
  - Deepen character development by exploring their backstories, motivations, and fears more thoroughly to create a stronger emotional connection with the reader.
4. Write the intro of the Airbnb horror story. Make the intro peaceful and about the Airbnb residence.
 - Introduce foreshadowing elements early in the story to create anticipation and sow seeds of unease that will pay off during climactic moments.
 - Enhance the buildup of suspense by introducing more subtle and nuanced horror elements throughout the story, rather than relying on abrupt occurrences.
5. Continue with the action beats. Take them one by one and develop them in full detail describing back stories, consequences, details and emotions.
   Do not rush it, let the story unfold little by little. Remember we are aiming for 12000 words.
   Use "show - dont tell" methodology.
6. Write a detailed ending. Make it a good one - like a lucky escape, the bad person did not cone back, or something like that. 
But leave it open ended. And if you feel for it a little aftermath (a realisation after coming home, a letter, a call, a photo...
..or something entirely diferent).
7. Output nothing but the story.
