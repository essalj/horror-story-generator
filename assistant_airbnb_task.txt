Hi, I have task for you.
I would like you to write a True Horror Short Story for my youtube channel.
It want it to be much like the stories you can find on reddit scary stories and like minded sites.
I want it to be at least 900-1200 words.
It is essential that it is grounded in realism so the audience believes in it.
0. I want the story to contin these elements: a dog that ends up the dead hero; a scary uninvited guest, a lucky getaway
1. Write a plot summmary for a horror story.
     - it is an Airbnb story that is highly realistic
     - it is a very scary story
     - it consits of 6 scenes
     - No supernatural stuff, just scary or weird people and events
     - Kepp the language easy to understand, so an 8th grader will get it too
     - Write it in 1st person
     - decide if the protagonist is male or female
2. For each scene create 1 image prompts that depicts the action
   - Make sure to describe persons on the image, so they are the right gender, age, race to support the story
      - let image prompt 1 describe the residence
4. Write the story
   - begin the story with a peaceful setting and an introduction where the Airbnb residence is described in very positive phrases
   - let the audience understand it is a story told from memory
   - for each scene write at least 150 words. Descrie thoughs, feelings, motivatiin and ambiance. 
     Build up the intensity, be very detailed in descriptions and use "show it- do not tell it" methodology.
     On each scene expand with additional details, backstories, characters interactions, 
     and internal monologues to enrich the narrative further
   - emphasize situations with intriguing dialogues 
   - describe emotions and eerie ambience in exquisite detail
   - end the story good...like a lucky escape, the bad person left, or soomething  like that. But  keep it open ended.
5. Save the story as txt-file
6. Output gender of the protagonist, image prompts in a json structure as outlined below

  {
  "protagonistGender": "male",
  "imagePrompts": [
    {
      "image_no": 1,
      "description": ""
    },
    {
      "image_no": 2,
      "description": ""
    }
    // Add more image prompts as needed
   ]
}
6. Output nothing but the json structure
